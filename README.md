# What's the purpose of this repo?
This is the repo for my blog site <https://satishkarki.com>.
Here I post about the things I love doing- something that helps me during my day job and some that tickles my personal interest as a hobby. 

I am using Hostinger to host this github page in my custom domain `www.satishkarki.com`. 

I have built a custom website from scratch- hand coded HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Looking back at it today in this agentic AI world, that seems to be a great feat and painful at the same time. The site was mostly static and difficult to scale and maintain. I wanted something where I can write my blog in markdown format, apply some cosmetics and push it to prod- that's when I stumbled upon this Jekyll theme. You add your markdown files under `_posts`, commit and push and github action do the heavy lifting. In few seconds, boom - the new post is available.

Here is the Chirpy starter if yoy are interested.


## Chirpy Starter [![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/jekyll-theme-chirpy)](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-theme-chirpy) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/cotes2020/chirpy-starter.svg?color=blue)][mit]

When installing the [**Chirpy**][chirpy] theme through [RubyGems.org][gem], Jekyll can only read files in the folders `/_data`, `/_layouts`, `/_includes`, `/_sass` and `/assets`, as well as a small part of options of the `/_config.yml` file from the theme's gem. If you have ever installed this theme gem, you can use the command `bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy` to locate these files.

The Jekyll team claims that this is to leave the ball in the user’s court, but this also results in users not being able to enjoy the out-of-the-box experience when using feature-rich themes.

To fully use all the features of **Chirpy**, you need to copy the other critical files from the theme's gem to your Jekyll site. The following is a list of targets:

```shell
.
├── _config.yml
├── _plugins
├── _tabs
└── index.html
```

To save you time, and also in case you lose some files while copying, we extract those files/configurations of the latest version of the **Chirpy** theme and the [CD][CD] workflow to here, so that you can start writing in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Follow the instructions in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of the basic environment. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) also needs to be installed.

## Installation

Sign in to GitHub and [**use this template**][use-template] to generate a brand new repository and name it `USERNAME.github.io`, where `USERNAME` represents your GitHub username.
